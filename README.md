# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the ability to collect, clean, and analyze a data set representing human activity recognition using smartphones. The data was collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to:
1. Merge the training and test sets to create one dataset.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Assign descriptive activity names to the dataset.
4. Label the dataset with descriptive variable names.
5. Create a tidy dataset with averages of each variable for each activity and subject.

## Steps to Run the Analysis

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Make sure you have `dplyr` installed.
   ```r
   install.packages("dplyr")
